| * | 65ed9c7 Move changes to debug information around.
| * | d26d152 Basic implementation of debug handling. Variable changes in BasePlayer and MovementHandler now send out update events. No visuals for debug menu yet though.
| * | ca1afb7 Alterations to how Detections are handled: moved the "lock" mechanism out of DetectionBase and into DetectionMiddleman, which is the component responsible for "gluing" enemies (and other NPCs) to the Detection system. Baseline implementation of SoundEmitter/Receiver/Type, with an Editor script for emitter: needs lots of testing.
| * | d481b7c Basic functionality of VisionDetection implemented. DetectionBase also mostly functional.
| * | cb64164 Implementation of GlobalReference. Beginning work on Detection stuff. Updates to LocalPlayer making use of GlobalReference to have a consistently referenceable object for LocalPlayer.
